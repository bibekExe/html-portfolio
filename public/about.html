<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>The habit of being curious and ambitious has always helped in excelling in my personal life as well as academic life till now. But i have also realized that being only these doesn't suffice in this highly competitive world. This thinking sets me on a journey to enhance my skills in hardware programming, web development and much more. I think for a broader technical world which is evident from my life.</p>
